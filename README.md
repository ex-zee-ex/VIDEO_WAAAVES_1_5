# VIDEO_WAAAVES_2

a video mixer, framebuffer delay, and feedback resynthesis engine built in openFrameworks https://openframeworks.cc/

(QUICK ADVERTISEMENT FOR MYSELF https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/ this is my website, there is a pay pal button on here, if you have a fun time with the software i make and can afford to send me a donation it is super appreciated, the more donations i recieve means the more time i can spend working on crazy awesome open source software)

OK! so installing from these files here on the github are kind of only for folks reasonably well versed in navigating openFrameworks already! I can't really help anyone out anymore with this sort of thing as the volume of requests has greatly outpaced the amount of time I can afford to spend on that! But for everyone who has no idea what the heck an open frame work is don't worry I jurry rigged a reasonable solution for yalls! Head on over to this link

and follow the instructions to get up and running!

## Building

Please ensure you have the [correct ofxNDI](https://github.com/nariakiiwatani/ofxNDI/) repository and that you checkout the `master` branch as the default branch is now set as v5 ad Video Waaaves needs v4.

If you are building via Make on OSX you may also need to edit the ADDON_LDFLAGS environment variable to point to the dylib, either in the root of this project or in the libs folder of the addon. eg:

```
osx:
	ADDON_LDFLAGS = -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker /Applications/openFrameworks/addons/ofxNDI4/libs/NDI/lib/osx/x64
```

(yes i know that is far from all of the parameters. I'll be frank, adding full midi support for every parameter would be pretty boring and time consuming and adds very little to my personal usage of this software! if you want more midi ccs mapped to parameters you'll basically have to pay me because its a lot of dang work and i don't have any midi controllers with 200 knobs to use with this set up so)
